# leetcode
here are all my leetcode solutions, feel free to use it as inspiration to solutions of your own and show me ways to improve it.

I'll be posting as I go along with solving the problems. Not focusing in making it as optimized as possible, just being accepted will be good for me, but if you have any advice, please comment.



NOTE: The name of each awnser is the same name of the function provided by the exercise.
Example:
    
    class Solution {
    public:
        int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {

        }
    };
  
  the awnser's file name will be: findMaxConsecutiveOnes

  P.S: my commit messages from now on will be in this syntax: "problem name | difficulty | language"
    if updated for any reason: "problem name | difficulty | language | version : reason of change", for example:
    - (minor) I made small changes: v1.0.1;
    - (patch) I changed a block of code: v1.1.0;
    - (major) I changed the way I solved: v2.0.0
